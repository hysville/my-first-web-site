      often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core
      technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023,
      98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,
      often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a
      dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

      JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that
      conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing,
      prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
      multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative
      programming styles.<br />
      It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text,
      dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document
      Object Model (DOM).
